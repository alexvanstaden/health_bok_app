"""Claude adapter for the StanceJudge port (issue #18).

Weighs one newly-arrived piece of knowledge (a Claim or Protocol) against one of
the owner's anchors (a Decision, Goal, or Marker) and returns the Stance — the LLM
pass that keeps the Impact inbox honest (CONTEXT.md "Stance"): Concept overlap made
them candidates, but only a judged stance becomes an Impact, so the owner sees
genuine change rather than everything merely-related.

The contract:

  * return exactly one of `reinforces | contradicts | refines | opportunity`, or
    `unrelated` to discard the pair,
  * `opportunity` is reserved for an anchor the knowledge opens a *new* option for
    (classically an unmet Goal with no serving Decision),
  * judge only this one pair — never invent anchors or knowledge.

The model returns strict JSON; the `impacts` engine is the backstop — it discards
any out-of-vocabulary stance — so a sloppy response can never mint an Impact the
table's CHECK would reject. The provider call goes through an injected `ChatModel`,
so the adapter is provider-neutral; the orchestrator only ever sees the
`StanceJudge` port. Mirrors the `ChatQueryAnswerer` adapter shape; the model is
configurable (default the configured provider's) via STANCE_MODEL.
